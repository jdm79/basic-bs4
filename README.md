# Basic intro to web scraping with Python and BeautifulSoup

This is the rough first draft of my web scraping tutorial, which I'll be updating over the next few months (whilst in lockdown here in Berlin).

It's a very basic intro to web scraping using [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [BeautifulSoup library](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) to request HTML from web pages, grab what you want, clean it up and then do whatever you want with it. We won't be using a virtual environment or any complex, refactored code in this exercise - just the bare minimum to get going - and to get some results.

For now we will only be using two libraries - requests (to make the HTTP request to the target website to grab the HTML) and bs4 (BeautifulSoup - to take what we want from the returned HTML, clean it up and so on).
