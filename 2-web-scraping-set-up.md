# Set-up

Setting up anything in coding is often half the battle.

Install a code editor (preferably Visual Code).

Install [Visual Code here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

To open your terminal, press CMD and spacebar together and type 'terminal', then open it up.

On your terminal type:
(Don't type the dollar sign - that's already there on the terminal. type everything after the $)

```
$python --version
```

If it is something like 2.7.16, type the following on your terminal:
```
$python3 --version
```
I'm on 3.9.0 but anything with over 3 is good for this. Because Python 2 is still around on some machines, you might have to type:

```
$python3 app-1.py
```

This will use Python 3 to run/install things. In newer Macs this might not be an issue, but the best way to check is by trying both.

The next thing we will need is Pip. Type the following in your terminal:
```
$pip3 --version
```

I have version 20.3.3. As long as it's around that, it's fine. If you do not have pip, you will need to install it by typing the following into your terminal (using Homebrew):
```
$brew install pip3
```
