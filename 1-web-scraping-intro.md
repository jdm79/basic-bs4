# Basic intro to web scraping for journalists

For this exercise we want to write a Python script that visits the [Office for National Statistics (ONS) research and statistics page](https://www.gov.uk/search/research-and-statistics). This is a constantly updated list of articles and datasets. Publications, institutes, academics and private companies jump on these as soon as they come out, to make data graphics, find stories, obtain specific data etc. Whatever. 

For this exercise we just want to scrape the titles of the latest published articles/stats docs. Is there anything interesting? This could be handy if you had a specific interest in something that is often published on ONS: you could add to your script a checker which alerts you if it's something you want - or have some code that downloads the stats file automatically to a database or perhaps emails it to you.

Or in this case, make a list of the latest titles which you can look at in your terminal.
