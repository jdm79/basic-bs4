# Basic intro to web scraping for journalists

For this exercise we want to write a Python script that visits the [Office for National Statistics (ONS) research and statistics page](https://www.gov.uk/search/research-and-statistics). This is a constantly updated list of articles and datasets. Publications, institutes, academics and private companies jump on these as soon as they come out, to make data graphics, find stories, obtain specific data etc. Whatever. 

For this exercise we just want to scrape the titles of the latest published articles/stats docs.
