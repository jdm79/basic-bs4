The scraped HTML page will be returned in your terminal. 

Have a look at the div tags and see where the information you want to scrape is. 

These are the tags we will target in the next little scrape.

One of the best ways to identify where to target HTML tags (on Chrome anyway) is to right-click inspect
 and browse the 'elements' section and hover over, click and search through the different tags to see where
  the information you want is. 
  
  When you hover over the different divs in 'elements' you will see on the left on the website itself 
  what you are hovering over.
